# Docker PHP-FPM 7.3 & Nginx 1.16 on Alpine Linux
Example PHP-FPM 7.3 & Nginx 1.16 setup for Docker, build on [Alpine Linux](http://www.alpinelinux.org/).
The image is only +/- 35MB large.

Repository: https://github.com/erseco/alpine-php7-webserver


* Built on the lightweight and secure Alpine Linux distribution
* Very small Docker image size (+/-35MB)
* Uses PHP 7.3 for better performance, lower cpu usage & memory footprint
* Optimized for 100 concurrent users
* Optimized to only use resources when there's traffic (by using PHP-FPM's ondemand PM)
* Use of runit instead of supervisord to reduce memory footprint
* The servers Nginx, PHP-FPM run under a non-privileged user (nobody) to make it more secure
* The logs of all the services are redirected to the output of the Docker container (visible with `docker logs -f <container name>`)
* Follows the KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid) to make it easy to understand and adjust the image to your needs
* Also availabe in Apache flavour: `erseco/alpine-php7-webserver:apache`

## Usage

Start the Docker container:

    docker run -p 80:8080 erseco/alpine-php7-webserver

See the PHP info on http://localhost, or the static html page on http://localhost/test.html

Or mount your own code to be served by PHP-FPM & Nginx

    docker run -p 80:8080 -v ~/my-codebase:/var/www/html erseco/alpine-php7-webserver


## Adding additional daemons
You can add additional daemons (e.g. your own app) to the image by creating runit entries. You only have to write a small shell script which runs your daemon, and runit will keep it up and running for you, restarting it when it crashes, etc.

The shell script must be called `run`, must be executable, and is to be placed in the directory `/etc/service/<NAME>`.

Here's an example showing you how a memcached server runit entry can be made.

    #!/bin/sh
    ### In memcached.sh (make sure this file is chmod +x):
    # `chpst -u memcache` runs the given command as the user `memcache`.
    # If you omit that part, the command will be run as root.
    exec 2>&1 chpst -u memcache /usr/bin/memcached

    ### In Dockerfile:
    RUN mkdir /etc/service/memcached
    ADD memcached.sh /etc/service/memcached/run

Note that the shell script must run the daemon **without letting it daemonize/fork it**. Usually, daemons provide a command line flag or a config file option for that.


## Running scripts during container startup
You can set your own scripts during startup, just add your scripts in `/docker-entrypoint-init.d/`. The scripts are run in lexicographic order.

All scripts must exit correctly, e.g. with exit code 0. If any script exits with a non-zero exit code, the booting will fail.

The following example shows how you can add a startup script. This script simply logs the time of boot to the file /tmp/boottime.txt.

    #!/bin/sh
    ### In logtime.sh (make sure this file is chmod +x):
    date > /tmp/boottime.txt

    ### In Dockerfile:
    ADD logtime.sh /docker-entrypoint-init.d/logtime.sh


## Configuration
In [config/](config/) you'll find the default configuration files for Nginx, PHP and PHP-FPM.
If you want to extend or customize that you can do so by mounting a configuration file in the correct folder;

Nginx configuration:

    docker run -v "`pwd`/nginx-server.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/server.conf" erseco/alpine-php7-webserver

PHP configuration:

    docker run -v "`pwd`/php-setting.ini:/etc/php7/conf.d/settings.ini" erseco/alpine-php7-webserver

PHP-FPM configuration:

    docker run -v "`pwd`/php-fpm-settings.conf:/etc/php7/php-fpm.d/server.conf" erseco/alpine-php7-webserver

_Note; Because `-v` requires an absolute path I've added `pwd` in the example to return the absolute path to the current directory_


## Adding composer

If you need composer in your project, here's an easy way to add it;

```dockerfile
FROM erseco/alpine-php7-webserver:latest

# Install composer from the official image
COPY --from=composer /usr/bin/composer /usr/bin/composer

# Run composer install to install the dependencies
RUN composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-interaction --no-progress
```
